# FinalYearProject
My final year project. Formula Student: Design of a Battery and Battery Management System

I started by designing the battery from a 20700 (as you see in design 1 & 2 in the deliverables) but had to do a hard pivot when I noticed the design didn't seem to be feasible. The final design was done with 18650 cells.
